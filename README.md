# Hello-World
My coding Journey
I'm new to programing. I'm learning HTML and CSS right now and work my way toward other languages as well. I find writing a code can be very interesting and I can lose track of time while I am coding. I also love to travel and my gold is to travel every courntry around the world as of right now I've been to 19 countries and counting.
